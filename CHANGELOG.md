# Unreleased Changes

* None

# [Version v0.5.2](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.5.2)

* Tweaks to the BOM outputs, including an HTML format BOM
* Revised voltages for each capacitor, specifying the minimum acceptable
   * Most parts still specify a component that is better than the minimum, because of availability or price.

# [Version v0.5.1](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.5.1)

* Moved BOOT0 silkscreen
* Moved labels for BMC SWD and UART ports
* Moved some vias near the BMC to improve the ground pour
* Added version numbers to the release outputs
* Added PNG, SVG and STEP releaseoutputs

# [Version v0.5.0](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

* Sent to JLCPCB to assembly.
   * Note that C901 and C902 part no.s were wrong and were manually fixed before ordering.
* Replaced SIP resistor array for PS/2 ports with four SMD resistors

# [Version v0.4.0](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

* Swap fill on bottom layer to be 3.3V not Ground
* Replace RTC with DIP package due to availability
* Increase size of electrolytic capacitor footprint, to better suit size of common parts
* Replaced VGA connector - in-stock ones have the pins set back from the board edge

# [Version v0.3.0](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* Adds via stitching around the edge of the board

# [Version v0.2.0](https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

* First complete PCB layout
